 Introduction to Pandas

## **What the assignment was about:**
The assignment was about learning how to use Pandas to read csv and xlsx files.

## **Something I learned in the process:**
I learnt how to make graphs using pandas â€” that was neat! I learnt how to order them, how to name them, and *even* title them!

## **Something I found challenging:**
I was stuck on question 8 for a long time because I didn't realize groupby required a calculation. I kept doing it halfway and wondering why nothing was working. It forced me to learn when exactly to use "sort_values" and when to use "groupby."
